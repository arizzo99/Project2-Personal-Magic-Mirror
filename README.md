# Project2-Personal Magic Mirror
 

I made sure my mirror was open and not very clumped together.
Everything that my mirror offers will be programmed, which is what you can find in the settings.
For example like your personal info and social media will be logged in so the mirror has the correct credentials to keep up with you weekly, monthly, and yearly.
It also consists of a sleep log to make sure youre getting a healthy amount of sleep each day.
A cool addition to the mirror is the weather feature.
The feature consists of in home residence temp along with outside temperature.
In my opinion an important feature is a clock for many reasons including a lost phone or even a phone in another room to where you cant know what time it is.
Making a digital clock in the middle of the screen and making it one of the largest features makes it easy and not confusing to know exactly what the time and date.
On the top of the mirror the voice command is a cool feature because the mirror may be confusing to some and having a button that takes you where ever you ask is crucial and my eyes mandatory especially with people with poor vision.
A password is requireed when trying to log into the social media and text message drop bar. I feel like adding this was very necessary due to confident and private infortmation that the owner may not want to release.

And the best and last feature the mirror has to offer is our screen sharing. Logging into the mirror wifi will give you access to the mirrors screen. By doing this you can watch movies, sports, youtube, and etc while doing whatver you need to do in the bathroom.
