# Project2-Personal Magic Mirror
 


    Some of the general information that the mirror will provide are

        personalized calendar events for today

        personalized news feed items, text messages, social feed items,  

        clock 

        local weather

        Password login or face recognition is not required?

        The mirror should be connected to Wifi and synched with your smart phone (not required) --> Use data and csv vor json format


    The mirror should also provide health-related information such as

        how long you slept last night, how much was light sleep vs deep sleep, and how your total hours sleep compares to the last week of data 

        your current weight (assuming you have a scale embedded in the floor in front of the mirror), and how it compares to the last week of data 

        how many steps you took, how long you stood, and how long you exercised yesterday, and how that compares to the last week of data on a time series plot.

        how long do you spend in front of the mirror in the morning and evening?


    Some other advanced features the system should do

        allow the user to customize the display - e.g. the widget sizes and locations (drag and drop items in the desired location on the screen)

        Voice command: play music when you are brushing your teeth or in the shower - how do you control the playlist?

        act as a light source (with different possible colours)

        your imagination
